# Amazon-UI 

Welcome to the Amazon.com UI Clone! This project is a front-end recreation of Amazon's homepage, crafted solely using HTML and CSS. It's designed to mimic the layout, styles, and elements of the Amazon website, providing a responsive, visually accurate replica for practice and learning purposes.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The aim of this project is to develop a responsive clone of Amazon.com’s user interface using only HTML and CSS, with a focus on replicating key sections like the header, product categories, search bar, product grid, and footer. By building this project, I explored the essential concepts of CSS styling, Flexbox, and responsive design, creating a practical replica of a modern e-commerce homepage.
